This is a classification model used to segment customers into different clusters. The number of clusters was selected on the basis of the Silhouette Method. Several classification algorithms like SVM, kNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting were used to find the best model and finally the three best models were selected for the final ensemble. The final accuracy of the model came out to be 76%.
